# Practice: Python Variables & Data Types 1

## Submitting Your Work
 - Save your files to a new GitHub repo named: ***variables-data-types1***
 - Submit on Google Classroom the web address (URL) that points to your repo 

## Overview

Write a script that shows you know how to work with:
 - string variables
 - numeric variables (integers and floats)
 - the Boolean data type in Python (True or False)

## Sample Output

Your finished project should look similar to this example:

![The San Juan Mountains in New Mexico](san-juan-mtns-nm.png "San Juan Mountains")

## Helpful Resources

 - [How to name your Python variables](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_variables_names.asp)
 - [Using the print function to display the value assigned to a Python variable](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_variables_output.asp)

## Directions

 - Add a comment block to the top of your script, like so:
> ```python
> # Mike Jenkins
> # 03 SEP 20XX
> # Python Variables
> ```
 - Use comments to divide your script into three sections
   - Numeric Variables
   - String Variables
   - Boolean Variables
