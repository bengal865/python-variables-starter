# Practice: Python Variables & Data Types 

## Submitting Your Work
 - Save your files to a new GitHub repo named: ***variables-data-types-python***
 - Submit on Google Classroom the web address (URL) that points to your **PUBLIC** repo 

## Overview

Write a script that shows you know how to work with:
 - string variables
 - numeric variables (integers and floats)
 - the Boolean data type in Python (True or False)

## Helpful Resources

 - About [Python variables](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_variables.asp)
 - [How to name your Python variables](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_variables_names.asp)
 - [Using the print function to display the value assigned to a Python variable](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_variables_output.asp)
 - Need to add comments to your Python script? See the three comments in the comment block below under the **Directions** heading 
 
## Directions

 - Add a comment block to the top of your script, like so:
 ```python
# Mike Jenkins
# 03 SEP 20XX
# Python Variables
```
- Use comments to divide your script into three sections
   - Numeric Variables
   - String Variables
   - Boolean Variables
- Under **Numeric Variables**:
  -  assign your age as an integer to a variable named `age`
  -  assign as an integer the number of people in your immediate family to a variable named `num_family_members`
  -  assign as a float how much you earn per hour at your job; name the variable `hourly_wage`
- Under **String Variables**:
  -  assign your last name to a variable named `last_name`
  -  assign the name of your sending school to a variable named `sending_school`
  -  assign the name of one of your pets to a variable `my_pet`
- Under **Boolean Variables**:
  -  assign the value True (note the capitalization) to a variable named `is_student`
  -  depending on what grade you're in, assign the value True (or False) to a variable named `is_junior`
  -  depending on whether you know how to speak French or not, assign the value True or False to a variable `speaks_french`
-  At the bottom of your script, use multiple print statements and the Python *f-string* to display the values assigned to your numeric, string and Boolean variables
-  Use a pair of **double or single quotation marks** to build your f-string

> ```python
> # Printing my last name
> print(f'My last name is {last_name}.')
>
> # Printing my age
> print(f"I am {age} years old.")
